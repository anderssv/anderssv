- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anderssv
- I write code
- And talk about it
- Like, a lot

I am passionate about creating value for users through software and have a long history of working with agile and devops. Systems should solve problems for real users with minimal complexity, and I believe there are ways of doing that a lot better than most of the industry is doing today. Hit me up and I'd be glad to talk about your challenges.
